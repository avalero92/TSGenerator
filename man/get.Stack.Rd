\description{
rocesses vegetation index files and adds QFLAG layers.
}
\details{
Ehis function searches for .TIFF files of vegetation indexes (VI) in a specified directory,
and for each file, it tries to find a corresponding QFLAG file.
If found, the QFLAG file is re-scaled to match
the resolution of the VI file and is added as a new layer.
Finally, the resulting file is saved in an output directory.
